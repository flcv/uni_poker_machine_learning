# About
This repo contains a self-directed final project for a university subject; "Real and Artificial Neural Networks".

It investigated if a general machine learning model can be considered a good approach for any given task (in this case, playing Poker).

The justification is that if General AI is to be a reality, it is simply impossible to develop an optimal model or training strategy for every possible task it could be required to perform.
